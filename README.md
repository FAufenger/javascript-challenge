## Background

WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at ALIENS-R-REAL have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.
<br>
<br>
There is just one tiny problem though... our collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.
<br>
<br>
Thats why we need a code that will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset provided. We also need to allow users to filter the table data for specific values. There's a catch though... we only use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on our web pages. They are the only coding languages which can be trusted.

## Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search 

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, code appends a table to a web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
* Uses a date form in HTML document to write JavaScript code that listens for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.

<br>

## Level 2: Multiple Search Categories

* Utilizes multiple input tags and a select dropdown to either inclusively or exclusively filter the provided dataset
* JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using and and alll the following criteria based on the table columns:
   * date/time
   * city
   * state
   * country
   * shape
